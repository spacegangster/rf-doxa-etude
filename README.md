## doxa + re-frame study
![todo app main screen](/resources/screenshot1.png?raw=true "re-frame-doxa-study")

A barebone todo list app combining [doxa](https://github.com/ribelo/doxa) DB and re-frame.

Doxa is a new Clojure DB that works both on frontend and backend and strikes a good balance
between usability, features and speed.


doxa is added as a submodule, and shadow-cljs expects it to be found in ./doxa/src


### Clone and play
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/spacegangster/rf-doxa-etude

(if submodules won't work see this guide
