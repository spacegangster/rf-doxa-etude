## doxa + re-frame etude
This etude combines [doxa](https://github.com/ribelo/doxa) and re-frame.
Doxa is a new Clojure DB that works both on frontend and backend and strikes a good balance
between usability, features and speed.


doxa is added as a submodule, and shadow-cljs expects it to be found in ./doxa/src


### Clone and play
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/spacegangster/rf-doxa-etude

(if submodules won't work see this guide
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796927/how-to-git-clone-including-submodules)
